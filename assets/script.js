//Add a button that says Play New Game that clears all the data for a new game

//Allow user to enter information in each form. Use event listeners

//Allow user to play a mini-game in which they catch hearts, cash, babies, and avoid bombs in an allotted time
//Hearts, cash, and babies earn player 1 point each but bombs earn -2 points
//Keep score, and when time runs out display that number to them

//That number will be used to count how many answers to skip over before crossing them out and eliminating them from the fortune

//Stop the elimination of answers in each div after there is only one answer left
//Once there is only one answer left in each div, stop elimination all together and display fortune



//FOR EVERY HTML PAGE AFTER HOMEPAGE
