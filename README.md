# MASH 

## This is a browser game that allows the user to predict their future! It will give users opportunities to enter information, draw on the screen, and watch a fun animation of their life unfold

### MASH was a fun and easy way to distract ourselves in childhood. Much like tic-tac-toe, all we needed was a pencil and paper. My friends and I loved to try and get the best future possible. We would choose to add undesirable options to shake things up too.
