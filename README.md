### Game Description

#### This is a browser game that predicts the player's future! They will enter answers, play a mini game, and watch an animation of their fortune unfold.

#### M.A.S.H. was a fun and easy way to distract ourselves in our childhood. Much like tic-tac-toe, all we needed was a pencil and paper. 

#### For this game, you will have to come up with three answers for each category: 2 things you want in your fortune and 1 you don't (enter in whatever order you want for each category). Then, to meet the game requirements, you will play a minigame for points -- in lieu of drawing a spiral in a typical game of M.A.S.H. -- in which you move a playable character across the screen to catch items while avoiding bombs. Your resulting score will be used on the following page with a list of all of your previous answers separated by category. The game will count each answer on the page until it counts up to the number you scored. Then it will cross off the answer it lands on. This will continue until there is only one item remaining in each category. Those items are then used in your fortune.
