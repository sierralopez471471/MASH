# M.A.S.H. 

#### This is a browser game that predicts the user's future! It gives users opportunities to enter information, play a mini game, and watch a fun animation of their life unfold.

#### M.A.S.H. was a fun and easy way to distract ourselves in childhood. Much like tic-tac-toe, all we needed was a pencil and paper. 

#### The players will have to come up with three answers for each category: 2 things they want in their fortune and 1 they don't. Then, in order to meet the game requirements, they will play a mini game for points -- in lieu of drawing a spiral -- in which they move a playable character across the screen to catch items while avoiding bombs. Their resulting score will be used on the following page with all of their previous answers listed. Depending on the number the player scores, the game will count each item down the page and cross off the answers it lands on. The remaining items in each category are then used to tell the player their fortune.
